        <li>3/4 cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>4 oz (120 g) baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 quart (litre) of water, as needed</li>

    </p>

    <h2>Preparation Time</h2>
    <p>Time needed: 45 mins</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook onion for 2 minutes, then add garlic, celery and carrots;
            cook for 5
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken thighs, broth (stock), crushed bouillon, green beans and corn kernels. Top up with water if
            needed to
            cover all of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Increase heat and bring to a boil for about 4 minutes. Reduce heat, partially cover the pot with a lid, and
            allow to
            simmer for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a plate and shred the meat; discard the bones.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back into the soup along with the noodles. Cover and cook for 6-8 minutes while stirring
            occasionally to
            separate noodles.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spinach leaves and allow to wilt in the soup (about 3 minutes, pressing leaves into the liquid
            with the tip
            of a wooden spoon). Mix parsley through. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Serve warm</li>
    </ol>
