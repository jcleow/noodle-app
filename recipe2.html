    <p>Time needed: 45 mins</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 325ºF. In a large resealable plastic bag, place the flour and the chicken pieces and shake to
            coat. Heat
            the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally,
            until
            browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, carrots, fennel and 2 tsp of the garlic to the saucepan and cook,
            covered,
            stirring occasionally, until golden brown and tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring and
            scraping up
            any brown bits for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, rosemary, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and simmer for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to pan, cover and bake until the chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the orzo according to package directions. In a small bowl, combine the parsley, lemon zest
            and the
            remaining garlic. Sprinkle chicken with parsley mixture and serve with cooked orzo.</li>
    </ol>
